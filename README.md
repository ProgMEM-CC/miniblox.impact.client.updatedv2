## An Overview of Impact for Miniblox
**Impact Client for Miniblox.io** is a fully standalone continuation of the discontinued **Vape for Miniblox** project by `7GrandDadPGN`.  
When the original client was deleted, **TheM1ddleM1n**, **DataM0del (aka RealPacket)**, and **ProgMEM-CC** and other devs rebuilt it from scratch ‚Äî creating a modern, modular, and optimized exploit client framework for Miniblox. :trollface:

> Designed for stealth, speed, and domination ‚Äî with full dark-mode support with a slick Click GUI.

## How to Install Impact For Miniblox?
First, install a userscript manager (üß© **Tampermonkey**, **Violentmonkey** or **Greasemonkey** via Chrome Web Store or Microsoft Store etc).  

Next, copy the contents of `tampermonkey.js` and (`optional`) `injection.js`. The best option imo is to copy and paste both `tampermonkey` and `injection` - TheM1ddleM1n

Then, paste it into a new userscript and enable it. (u should see it save)

Finally, open [Miniblox.io](https://miniblox.io) ‚Äî the client will auto-initialize!

And then enjoy using the client!
