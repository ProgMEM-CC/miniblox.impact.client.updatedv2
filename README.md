## An Overview of Impact for Miniblox
**Impact Client for Miniblox.io** is a fully standalone continuation of the discontinued **Vape V4** project/client by `7GrandDadPGN`.  
When the original client was deleted, **TheM1ddleM1n**, **DataM0del (aka RealPacket)**, and **ProgMEM-CC** and other devs rebuilt it from scratch ‚Äî creating a modern, modular, and optimized exploit client framework for Miniblox. :trollface: (gl on bypassing this vector)

> Designed for stealth, speed, and domination ‚Äî with full dark-mode support with a slick Click GUI.

## How to Install Impact For Miniblox?
First, install a userscript manager (üß© **Tampermonkey**, **Violentmonkey** or **Greasemonkey** via Chrome Web Store or Microsoft Store etc).  

Next, copy the contents of `tampermonkey.js` and (`optional`) `injection.js`. The best option imo is to copy and paste both `tampermonkey` and `injection` - TheM1ddleM1n

Then, paste it into a new userscript and enable it. (u should see it save)

Finally, open [miniblox.io](https://miniblox.io) ‚Äî the client will auto-initialize!

And then enjoy using the client!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Any known issues will be commented here:

- There is currently an issue with Killaura and Nuker. However, we are looking into it.

## üß© Developer Notes!

Make sure you **always** update VERSIONFILE, tampermonkey.js, and injection.js together. (as soon as ProgMEM-CC fixes the issue with "Github Actions being disabled")

Never publish unstable code to / (root). Use /beta for any test builds you have got.

Repo rename pending once closed-source dependencies are synced.

An apology here firstly, i dont know why, but my account seems to have github actions disabled @TheM1ddleM1n sorry about your CI.

(you can contact github support saying that github actions has been disabled for you to see if they fix it.)

**ok dont worry then i made a PR anyway and its at v6.6 - TheM1ddleM1n**
