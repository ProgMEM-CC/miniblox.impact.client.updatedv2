## An Overview of Impact for Miniblox
**Impact Client for Miniblox.io** is a fully standalone continuation of the discontinued **Vape for Miniblox** project by `7GrandDadPGN`.  
When the original client was deleted, **TheM1ddleM1n**, **DataM0del (aka RealPacket)**, and **ProgMEM-CC** and other devs rebuilt it from scratch ‚Äî creating a modern, modular, and optimized exploit client framework for Miniblox. :trollface:

> Designed for stealth, speed, and domination ‚Äî with full dark-mode support with a slick Click GUI.

## How to Install Impact For Miniblox?
First, install a userscript manager (üß© **Tampermonkey**, **Violentmonkey** or **Greasemonkey** via Chrome Web Store or Microsoft Store etc).  

Next, copy the contents of `tampermonkey.js` and (`optional`) `injection.js`. The best option imo is to copy and paste both `tampermonkey` and `injection` - TheM1ddleM1n

Then, paste it into a new userscript and enable it. (u should see it save)

Finally, open [Miniblox.io](https://miniblox.io) ‚Äî the client will auto-initialize!

And then enjoy using the client!

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Any Known Issues

- .toggle all command currently non-functional (fix planned soon..).
- there is a issue with Killaura and Nuker. However, this will be fixed.

## Ideas for new modules!

- [ ] Force OP module (gain access to admin commands?!)
- [ ] Command Block modification (to change command blocks in survival)
- [ ] AutoEat (Automatically eats food in the inv)
- [ ] AimBot (Automatically aims at a player)
- [ ] Full Disabler (Possibly other Disabler methods)

## üß© Dev Notes

Always update VERSIONFILE, tampermonkey.js, and injection.js together.

Never publish unstable code to / (root). Use /beta for testing builds.

Repo rename pending once closed-source dependencies are synced.
