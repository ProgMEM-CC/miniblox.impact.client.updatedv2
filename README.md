## An Overview for Impact For Miniblox!

**Impact For Miniblox** is a fork of the **Vape V4** project by `DataM0del`
(which is a continuation of the discontinued **Vape V4** project by `7GrandDadPGN`).
Before the original client was deleted ([xylex fake quit moment](https://github.com/7GrandDadPGN/7granddadpgn/commit/46a3b9e9afea226f730b9d9eaf10788b993d43ee#commitcomment-152355396)) 🥀
<!-- why am I adding all of these dates, this isn't history class LOL -->
`**DataM0del (aka RealPacket)**` started updating it 13 days before that comment, and then stopped 2 days after.
But it was fully reusable 3 days after that comment, and then, the first updated version of Vape, 3.0.0, was released.

It is designed for stealth (from anticheats), speed, and total domination — with full dark-mode support with a slick Click GUI.

## Features

- AntiBan 2.0 (use non accounts OR generate accounts with **[miniblox-acc-gen](https://codeberg.org/RealPacket/miniblox-acc-gen)'s** integration support!)
- Fly, NoFall, NoFallBeta, and Scaffold!
- A Useable Click GUI
- ServerCrasher (this works on servers without the new AC, e.g. planets)
- Nuker (still in BETA, it sends too many block break packets and gets you kicked for this.)
- Jetpack (this is literally just the old Fly from Vape For Miniblox, this probably still works.)
- 2ND ClickGUI created by me (TheM1ddleM1n)
- Script manager/Bug Report function in game (Thanks dtkiller-jp!)

## How to install our client?

First, install a userscript manager (🧩 **Tampermonkey**, **Violentmonkey** or **Greasemonkey** via Chrome Web Store or Microsoft Store etc).

Next, copy the contents of `tampermonkey.js`.

Then, paste it into a new userscript and enable it. (you should see it save automatically!)

Finally, open **[miniblox.io](https://miniblox.io)** — the client will auto-initialize!

And then enjoy using the client!

## ⚠️ Any known issues will be commented here

- `.toggle all` command is currently non-functional. (I think the panic module should work?)
- There is currently an issue with `Nuker`. (via a lot of packets sent you will get kicked instantly.)
- `FastBreak` doesn't work (Looking into it.)
- Reach is limited to 6 (this is the same for killaura) due to Vector's goofy ahh anticheat.
- linking to killaura sometimes in the air hits will not register (however, (this is a miniblox anticheat problem - thanks vector) and not our client))
- Scaffold does work 99% of the time, but sometimes you can get voided because of their new AntiLegit-I mean anticheat (again this is another vector issue 🥀)

## Ideas for some new modules (please look at this for a next step on making this client better!)
<!-- things in **bold** we will implement before V7 gets released - TheM1ddleM1n !-->

- [ ] Force OP module (gain access to admin commands?! funny bypass)
- [ ] Command Block modification (to change command blocks in survival)
- [ ] Spoof rank (ProgMEM-CC's idea) (again could be possible)
- [ ] **AutoEat (Automatically eats food in the inv)**
- [ ] AimBot (Automatically aims at a player)
- [ ] Inventory Manager – Organizes inventory automatically
- [ ] X-Ray (possible)
- [ ] Freecam (like PublicLurker client)
- [ ] SkinChanger in game (good idea)
- [ ] Reach fix (possible but its limited to 5-6 thanks to vector's goofy ahh anticheat)
- [ ] **NoSlow – Prevents slowdown from using items or cobwebs**
- [ ] Fullbright – Always max brightness. (funny mc client thing.)
- [ ] CustomCape / Wings / Breadcrumbs – Renders client-side cosmetics (it would be annoying with this current system to hook the game's API, but is still possible, because it's a render module)
- [ ] Small music player (ie. links to spotify) (like JoLean client)
- [ ] Render miniblox's HUDS (ie. health bar to mc like hearts)
- [ ] ArmorHUD (to improve my targetHUD ) (using exhibition)
- [ ] **AutoSword (*should be easy to do*)**
- [ ] CustomSky – Applies custom skybox textures
- [ ] AutoInsult / ComplimentBot – Randomly sends messages after kills (improvement to my AutoFunnyChat module) (like any mc client for example: Rise 7.4)

## 🧩 Developer Notes

Make sure you **always** update VERSIONFILE, tampermonkey.js, and injection.js together. (as soon as ProgMEM-CC fixes the issue with "Github Actions being disabled!")

Never publish unstable code to / (root). Use `/` `beta` for any test builds you have got.

## Repo rename pending once (the literally none) closed-source dependencies are synced

An apology here firstly, i dont know why, but my account seems to have github actions disabled @TheM1ddleM1n sorry about your CI.

## Important (FOR BETA) - Comment from TheM1ddleM1n

You can put out code (if it needs to be tested) without harming the main branch. However, if you do decide to put anything in BETA I will thoroughly test the idea and I will then give you feedback based on:- where to improve or if it is good to pull it into `vav4inject.js`!
