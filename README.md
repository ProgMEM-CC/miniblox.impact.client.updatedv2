## Overview - Impact for Miniblox!

**Impact Client for Miniblox.io** is a fork of the **Vape V4** project by `DataM0del`
(which is a continuation of the discontinued **Vape V4** project/client by `7GrandDadPGN`).
When the original client was deleted, `**TheM1ddleM1n**`, `**DataM0del (aka RealPacket)**`, and `**ProgMEM-CC**` and other devs rebuilt it from scratch ‚Äî creating a modern, modular, and optimized exploit client framework for Miniblox.

Designed for stealth, speed, and domination ‚Äî with full dark-mode support with a slick Click GUI.

## Features

- AntiBan 2.0 (use non accounts OR generate accounts with [miniblox-acc-gen](https://codeberg.org/RealPacket/miniblox-acc-gen)'s integration support!)
- Fly, NoFall, NoFallBeta, and Scaffold
- Click GUI
- ServerCrasher (works on servers without the new AC, e.g. planets)
- Nuker (still in BETA, it sends too many block break packets and gets you kicked for this.)
- Jetpack (this is literally just the old Fly from Vape For Miniblox, this probably still works.)
- 2ND ClickGUI created by me (TheM1ddleM1n)

## How to Install Impact For Miniblox?

First, install a userscript manager (üß© **Tampermonkey**, **Violentmonkey** or **Greasemonkey** via Chrome Web Store or Microsoft Store etc).

Next, copy the contents of `tampermonkey.js`.

Then, paste it into a new userscript and enable it. (you should see it save automatically!)

Finally, open [miniblox.io](https://miniblox.io) ‚Äî the client will auto-initialize!

And then enjoy using the client!

## üß© Developer Notes

Make sure you **always** update VERSIONFILE, tampermonkey.js, and injection.js together. (as soon as ProgMEM-CC fixes the issue with "Github Actions being disabled")

Never publish unstable code to / (root). Use /beta for any test builds you have got.

## Repo rename pending once closed-source dependencies are synced

An apology here firstly, i dont know why, but my account seems to have github actions disabled @TheM1ddleM1n sorry about your CI.

## Important (FOR BETA) - Comment from TheM1ddleM1n

You can put out code (if it needs to be tested) without harming the main branches. However, if you do decide to put anything in BETA i will thoroughly test the module/idea and i will give you feedback based on- where to improve or if it is good to pull it into `vav4inject.js`!
