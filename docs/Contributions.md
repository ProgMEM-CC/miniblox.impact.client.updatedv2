## Contribution Guidelines!

Keep the code modular and lightweight.

Use clear naming conventions. (refer to the agreed-upon rules or patterns that developers follow to keep the codebase clean, consistent, and easy to understand.)

Test **thoroughly** before submitting or ask me to test it for you!
